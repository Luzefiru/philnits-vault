Biometric authentication includes a verification method that extracts physical characteristics and another verification method that extracts behavioral characteristics. Which of the following is the method that uses behavioral characteristics?

a) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from pen speed and pressure when a signature is provided
b) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from the bifurcation angle of the bifurcation point of a blood vessel or from the distance between adjacent bifurcation points
c) Performing authentication by extracting the characteristic point called minutia from the pattern formed by ridges
d) Performing authentication by extracting the characteristics of chaotic wrinkles in the eye from the pupil to the outside
? 
a) Performing authentication by extracting characteristics from pen speed and pressure when a signature is provided

## Explanation

### Option a) (ANSWER)
- relates to ==how a person signs==
- aka signature recognition
	- identifies a person based on handwriting
- behavioral characteristic of a person

### Option b)
- bifurcation is where a line branches into a fork or two lines
- used in fingerprints
- not behavioral

### Option c)
- minutia are ridge endings and ridge bifurcations
- used in fingerprints, refer to option b)
- not behavioral

### Option d)
- relates to iris recognition biometrics
	- automated methods of biometric identification that use unique patterns in the eye to verify a person's identity
