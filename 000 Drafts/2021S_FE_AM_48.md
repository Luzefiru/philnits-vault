Which of the following is the weakest module coupling?

a) To implement as many functions as possible with a single module
b) To pass arguments that control another module’s logic when the module is called
c) To pass only required data items as arguments between two (2) modules
d) To use a global area to share data items with other modules
? 
c) To pass only required data items as arguments between two (2) modules

## Explanation

**Module coupling** 
- means to couple/group two to more modules with each other

**Types of module coupling:**
- **Low/weak Coupling** 
	- modules are independent of each other
	- enhances maintainability of modules
	- reduces the impact of changes in one module on others.
- **High/strong Coupling** 
	- modules are highly dependent on each other
	- maintenance and understanding of the system is more complex.

### Option a)
- most functions would be used by other modules
- leads to high coupling

### Option b)
- one module is  dependent on the other for logic controls
- increases dependency, high coupling

### Option c) (ANSWER)
- only parameters are the same
- operations are independent
- low coupling

### Option d)
- sharing data with other modules promote dependency
- high coupling
