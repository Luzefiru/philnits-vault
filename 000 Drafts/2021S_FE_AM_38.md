Which of the following is an encryption method that can be used for encrypting data managed in a database using the same key for encryption and decryption?

a) AES 
b) PKI 
c) RSA 
d) SHA-256
? 
a) AES 

## Explanation

### Option a) (ANSWER)
- advanced encryption standard
- ==uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data==
- used in:
	- Data on [storage media](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/storage-medium), including hard drives and USB drives.
	- Electronic communication apps.
	- Programming libraries.
	- Internet [browsers](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/browser).
	- File and disk [compression](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatabackup/tip/Compression-deduplication-and-encryption-Whats-the-difference).
	- [Wireless networks](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/tip/The-4-different-types-of-wireless-networks).
	- ==Databases==.
	- Login credentials including passwords.
	- Virtual private networking ([VPN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/virtual-private-network)).

### Option b)
- public key infrastructure
- ==encrypts keys==
	- **BUT USED TO SECURE INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS**
- governs the issuance of digital certificates to protect sensitive data
- provide unique digital identities for users, devices and applications
- secure end-to-end communications

### Option c)
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
- public-key cryptosystem that uses a ==key pair to encrypt and decrypt data==
- **BUT used primarily for secure key exchange and digital signatures**
- slower and more computationally intensive than AES
