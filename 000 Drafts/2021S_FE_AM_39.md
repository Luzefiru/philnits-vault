A given application only has the functions of retrieving and displaying user information from a database that stores such information. Considering information security management, which of the following is the appropriate database access right assigned to an account that the application uses when it accesses the database? The names and scopes of rights are listed below.

`[`The names and scopes of rights`]`

| Reference right:     | Permits a record to be selected<br>                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Update right:        | Permits a record to be inserted, updated, and dropped<br>      |
| Administrator right: | Permits a table to be displayed, created, altered, and dropped |

a) Administrator right 
b) Reference right
c) Update right 
d) Update right and reference right
? 
b) Reference right

## Explanation
Based on the problem, `the application only has the functions of retrieving and displaying user information`. 

Finding the appropriate access right should coincide or limit to what the application can do. So, inserting, updating, deleting, and modifying records or tables in the database is not necessary. Therefore, it should only stick to selecting records which is option `b) Reference right`
