c.) Sequence diagram - shows the order of messages exchanged between object including their lifelines and the interactions that occur during a particular scenario. Sequence diagrams are particularly useful for detailing the dynamic behavior of a system.
### Other Options

**a) Activity Diagram**: This diagram models the flow of activities and actions within a system, showing the dynamic aspects but not the time-ordered interactions between objects.

**b) Communication Diagram**: While this diagram also depicts the interactions between objects, it focuses more on the structural organization of the objects rather than the specific sequence of message exchanges.

**d) State-Machine Diagram**: This diagram represents the states of an object and the transitions between those states but does not focus on message exchanges among objects.
